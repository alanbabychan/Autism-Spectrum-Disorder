The primary goal of this project is to detect autism in infants through advanced technology. Developed using React.js and deep learning techniques, the project aims to leverage modern technologies for accurate early diagnosis. React.js facilitates the creation of a user-friendly interface, while deep learning algorithms analyze data to identify potential signs of autism. We are actively working on enhancing the system's accuracy and functionality, integrating the latest technological advancements. Updates on our progress will be provided soon, so stay tuned for further developments and improvements in this crucial area of healthcare.
